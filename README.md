# OdinLibrary

The goal of this project is to make a simple library app that contains information of books including their title, author, number of pages and whether they've been read or not by the user. 

Using prototype functions, every time a book is added to the library, it is also displayed on the web page. 
A button to remove a book from the library/ corresponding DOM element was added as well as a button that toggles the read status of the book.
